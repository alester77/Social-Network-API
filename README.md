# Social-Network-API

## Description

The Social-Network-API is a backend service designed to provide essential API endpoints for a social networking app. This project was born out of the motivation to understand and build the foundational backend functionality that powers social networking features such as user profiles, friendships, posts (thoughts), and reactions.

The purpose behind this project was not just to fulfill an academic requirement, but to tackle real-world challenges like handling complex data relationships and performing CRUD operations in a NoSQL database environment.

This project aims to solve the issue of managing unstructured data in a flexible and scalable way using MongoDB. Throughout the development process, I have deepened my understanding of RESTful API design, MongoDB document models, and the Mongoose ODM to manipulate data efficiently.
